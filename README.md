# D&D Dice Roller
A simple Python script to roll D&D dice 'd4','d6','d8','d10','d12','d20'
## Features
- Can run all dice at once or each one individually
- It shows **Critical Success** and **Critical Failure** on d20
- You can type exit to end because it keeps running until you specifically write exit and enter (at least for the current state of the code)
## LICENSING
- This project is under GPL license 
## Requirements
- Be sure to have python3 installed then run python3 on the current directory and have fun after typing python3 D6_D20.py unless you save it with a different name
## Trivia 
I made this as a separate and more powerful version of my first project and i still wanted to write this using unix/pythonic/suckless philosophy 
so it wont be an eyesore to understand,share,modify and run with as less ram as possible and i built this code in honour of my DM friend who's 
creating a campaign thats currently longer than **550** pages and at the same time to solve dices falling down or bad throws.
In the future if i see this code is worth it ill make an app that fuses all these codes in python that i wrote into a single massive yet clear and light 
android app but feel free to create it by yourself as long you respect licensing
